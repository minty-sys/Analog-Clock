# Analog-Clock
In this repository, i have created an analog clock with hour, minute and second hand using pure HTML, CSS and vanilla JS which helped me in revising my JS basics after a long time. This repository is completely responsive and you will surely like the way it shows the current time. Do have a look yourself :)
